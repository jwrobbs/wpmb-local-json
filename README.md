# wpmb-local-json
Activates ACF's Local JSON and provides a home for files. The README has important notes. (WordPress plugin)

# Status
Initial development

# Warnings
## Requires ACF
I believe the free version has Local JSON. [Get it here.] (https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/installing-and-upgrading-to-the-latest-version-of-acf/)

## Make your own fork! I don't even use this directly.
The plugin's purpose is storing your ACF data as JSON files. This provides version control of your ACF fields.

**_But you shouldn't upload that data to a public repo._**

This is a basic plugin that should never need to be updated. Fork it to a private repo.
